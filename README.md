# AI-Driven Learning Platform

## Project Overview

### üéØ The Value Proposition: Why AI Learning?

The traditional learning process is often **static and inefficient**, failing to address the unique pace and specific knowledge gaps of individual students.

Our platform solves this by offering a **dynamic, personalized learning experience**:

* **Outcome (The Gist):** We transform passive studying into **active, guided learning**, helping users grasp complex topics faster and more effectively.
* **Solution:** Users get **instant, customized lessons and explanations** generated by the AI model based on their submitted questions.
* **Problem:** Learners struggle with generic content that doesn't meet their specific needs or difficulty level.

This AI-driven learning platform allows users to select study topics, submit questions to an artificial intelligence model, and receive personalized lessons.

### üß± System Architecture

The project's backend is built on a **3-Tier Model**, ensuring clear separation of responsibilities and flexibility.

* **API Layer:** The outermost layer. Handles HTTP requests from the frontend and acts as the entry point to the system.
* **Business Logic Layer (BLL):** Contains all core business logic and rules for the platform.
* **Data Access Layer (DAL):** Solely responsible for all communication with the database (Microsoft SQL Server).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

**To run the project locally without Docker, the following software must be installed and configured:**

* **Backend (C# Based):**
    * **.NET 8.0 SDK** (Required to run the C# backend).
    * **Microsoft SQL Server 2019 Express Edition** (or a compatible full version).
        * The database must be installed and correctly configured to accept connections, as specified in the `appsettings.json` file.

* **Frontend (React Based):**
    * **Node.js** (Requires version **v24.8.0** or a compatible version within the **24.x** range).
    * **npm** (Node.js package manager).
        * The project uses **React 19.x** (version 19.1.1).

* **General:**
    * **Access to the AI Model API** (The integration with the model must be configured with valid credentials).

## üöÄ Local Installation and Run

### Backend

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Open the project in Visual Studio or a code editor and ensure all dependencies are loaded.
2.  **Database Connection:** Ensure the database Connection String in the `appsettings.json` file is correctly configured for your local SQL Server instance.
3.  **Run:** Navigate to the backend directory in your terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

### Frontend

1.  **Navigate to Directory:** Navigate to the frontend directory in your terminal.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Run the following command to install the required Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run:** Run the following command from the terminal to start the local development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    (The application should open automatically in your browser at: `http://localhost:3000`).
